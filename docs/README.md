# NAME

*powerkit* - desktop independent Linux power manager

# SYNOPSIS

powerkit *`[--config]`*

# DESCRIPTION

**NOTE:** powerkit version 2 is under heavy development, it may break at any time!

powerkit is an desktop independent Linux power manager for alternative X11 desktop environments and window managers.

 * Implements *[org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver](https://people.freedesktop.org/~hadess/idle-inhibition-spec/re01.html)* service
 * Implements *[org.freedesktop.PowerManagement](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/power-management-spec/)* service
 * Automatically suspend on idle
 * Automatically lock screen on idle
 * Automatically hibernate or shutdown on critical battery
 * Inhibit actions if external monitor(s) is connected
 * Screen locking support
 * Screen backlight support
 * RTC wake alarm support
 * CPU frequency scaling support
 * Thermal support
 * Notification support

# USAGE

powerkit should be started during the X11 user session. Consult the documentation for your desktop environment or window manager for launching startup applications.

 * In *Fluxbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.fluxbox/startup``* file
 * In *Openbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.config/openbox/autostart``* file.

**Do not run powerkit if your desktop environment already has a power manager!**

## CONFIGURATION

The most common options are available directly from the system tray icon, for more advanced options open *``Settings``* from the system tray menu or run *``powerkit --config``*. You should also be able to lauch the powerkit settings from your desktop application menu (if available).

## SCREEN SAVER

powerkit implements a basic screen saver to handle screen blanking, poweroff and locking feature.

Locking feature depends on ``xsecurelock``.

## BACKLIGHT

The current display brightness (on laptops and supported displays) can be adjusted with the mouse wheel on the system tray icon or through the system tray menu.

## HIBERNATE

If hibernate *"just works"* depends on your system, worst case a swap partition (or file) is needed by the kernel to support hibernate, just add *``resume=<swap_partition>``* to the kernel command line in the boot loader.

***Consult your system documentation regarding hibernation***.

## ICONS

powerkit will use the existing icon theme from the running desktop environment. You should have (a proper version) of Adwaita installed as a fallback.

You can override the icon theme in the *`~/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf`* file, see *``icon_theme=<theme_name>``*.

# FAQ

## How does an application inhibit the screen saver?

The preferred way to inhibit the screen saver from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* will work with powerkit.

Popular applications that uses this feature is Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, VideoLAN VLC and many more.

## How does an application inhibit suspend actions?

The preferred way to inhibit suspend actions from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* will work with powerkit.

Common use cases are audio playback, downloading, rendering and similar.

## Google Chrome/Chromium does not inhibit the screen saver!?

*[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)* does not use *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* or *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* until it detects a supported desktop environment. Add the following to *``~/.bashrc``* or the *``google-chrome``* launcher if you don't run a supported desktop environment:

```
export DESKTOP_SESSION=xfce
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=xfce
```

# REQUIREMENTS

powerkit requires the following dependencies:

 * *[X11](https://www.x.org)*
 * *[libXss](https://www.x.org/archive//X11R7.7/doc/man/man3/Xss.3.xhtml)*
 * *[libXrandr](https://www.x.org/wiki/libraries/libxrandr/)*
 * *[Qt5](https://qt.io)* *(Core/DBus/Gui/Widgets)*
 * *[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)*
 * *[logind](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/logind/)*
 * *[UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/)*
 * *[xsecurelock](https://github.com/google/xsecurelock)*

# BUILD

First make sure you have the required dependencies installed, then review the most common build options:

 * *``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</usr/local>``* - Install target. *``/usr``* recommended.
 * *``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release/Debug>``* - Build type. *``Release``* recommended
 * *``SERVICE_USER=<root>``* - powerkitd owner, needs write access to /sys. Usually the *``root``* user.
 * *``SERVICE_GROUP=<power>``* - Group that can access the powerkitd service, this should be any desktop user that can change screen brightness, CPU performance and RTC wake alarm. Usually the *``power``* group or similar. Consult your system documentation.

Now configure powerkit with CMake and build (*example for packaging purposes*).
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make DESTDIR=<package> install
```
```
