# SYNOPSIS

powerkit *`[--config]`* *`[--set-brightness-up]`* *`[--set-brightness-down]`*

# DESCRIPTION

Desktop independent Linux power manager for alternative X11 desktop environments and window managers.

 * Implements *``org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver``* service
 * Implements *``org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Inhibit``* service

   * Sleep
   * Hibernate
   * HybridSleep

   * Shutdown
 * Screen saver support
 * Screen lid support
 * Screen locking support
 * Screen backlight support
 * Notification support (can use *``org.freedesktop.Notifications``* if available)

# USAGE

powerkit should be started during the X11 user session. Consult the documentation for your desktop environment or window manager for launching startup applications.

 * In *Fluxbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.fluxbox/startup``* file
 * In *Openbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.config/openbox/autostart``* file.

**Do use powerkit if your desktop environment or window manager already has a power manager or screen saver service running.**

## CONFIGURATION

Settings are available directly from the system tray icon  or run *``powerkit --config``*. You should also be able to lauch the powerkit settings from your desktop application menu (if available).

## SCREEN SAVER

powerkit implements a basic screen saver to handle screen blanking, poweroff and locking feature.

Locking feature depends on ``xsecurelock``.

You can override the lock command with *``screensaver_lock_cmd=<command>``* in *`~/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf`*. Note that the command must not contain spaces.

## BACKLIGHT

The current display brightness (on laptops and supported displays) can be adjusted with the mouse wheel on the system tray icon or through the system tray menu.

powerkit also supports the following commands that can be used for global shortcuts, scripts etc:

*`powerkit --set-brightness-up`*
: Set default display brightness up.

*`powerkit --set-brightness-down`*
: Set default display brightness down.

## HIBERNATE

If hibernate works depends on your system, a swap partition (or file) is needed by the kernel to support hibernate.

***Consult your system documentation regarding hibernation***.

## ICONS

powerkit will use the existing icon theme from the running desktop environment or window manager.

You can override the icon theme in the *`~/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf`* file, use *``icon_theme=<theme_name>``*.

# FAQ

## How does an application inhibit the screen saver?

The preferred way to inhibit the screen saver from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* will work with powerkit.

Popular applications that uses this feature is Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, VideoLAN VLC and many more.

## How does an application inhibit suspend actions?

The preferred way to inhibit suspend actions from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* will work with powerkit.

Common use cases are audio playback, downloading, rendering and similar.

## Google Chrome/Chromium does not inhibit the screen saver or power manager!?

*[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)* does not use *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* or *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* until it detects a supported desktop environment. Add the following to *``~/.bashrc``* or the *``google-chrome``* launcher if you don't run a supported desktop environment:

```
export DESKTOP_SESSION=xfce
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=xfce
```

# REQUIREMENTS

powerkit requires the following dependencies:

 * *[X11](https://www.x.org)*
 * *[libXss](https://www.x.org/archive//X11R7.7/doc/man/man3/Xss.3.xhtml)*
 * *[libXrandr](https://www.x.org/wiki/libraries/libxrandr/)*
 * *[Qt](https://qt.io)* 5.15 *(Core/DBus/Gui/Widgets)*

# BUILD

First make sure you have the required dependencies installed, then review the most common build options:

 * *``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</usr/local>``* - Install target. *``/usr``* recommended.

make -j4
```

```
make DESTDIR=<package_directory> install
```
or

```
cpack -G DEB
```
```
cpack -G RPM
```
