# NAME

*powerkit* - desktop independent full featured power manager

# SYNOPSIS

powerkit *`[--config]`*

# DESCRIPTION

powerkit is an desktop independent full featured power manager for Linux, originally created for *[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/)* for use with alternative X11 desktop environments and window managers, like  *[Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)*, *[Blackbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbox)*, *[FVWM](http://www.fvwm.org/)*, *[WindowMaker](https://www.windowmaker.org/)*, *[Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page)*, *[Lumina](https://lumina-desktop.org/)*, *[Draco](https://dracolinux.org/)* and others.

 * Implements *[org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver](https://people.freedesktop.org/~hadess/idle-inhibition-spec/re01.html)* service
 * Implements *[org.freedesktop.PowerManagement](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/power-management-spec/)* service
 * Automatically suspend on idle
 * Automatically lock screen on idle
 * Automatically hibernate or shutdown on critical battery
 * Inhibit actions if external monitor(s) is connected
 * Screen locking support (Through XScreenSaver)
 * Screen backlight support
 * Screen hotplug support
 * RTC wake alarm support
 * CPU frequency scaling support
 * Thermal support

# USAGE

powerkit should be started during the X11 user session. An *XDG autostart* file is available, else consult the documentation for your desktop environment or window manager for launching startup applications.

 * In *Fluxbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.fluxbox/startup``* file
 * In *Openbox* add *``powerkit &``* to the *``~/.config/openbox/autostart``* file.

**Do not run powerkit if your desktop environment already has a power manager!**

## CONFIGURATION

The most common options are available directly from the system tray icon, for more advanced options open *``Settings``* from the system tray menu or run *``powerkit --conf``*. You should also be able to lauch the powerkit settings from your desktop application menu (if available).

## SCREEN SAVER

powerkit depends on *[XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)* to handle the screen locking feature and screen poweroff, the default settings may need to be adjusted. You can launch the configuration GUI with the *``xscreensaver-demo``* command.

Recommended settings are:

* Mode: *``Blank Screen Only``*
* Blank After: *``5 minutes``*
* Lock Screen After: *``enabled + 0 minutes``*
* Display Power Management: *``enabled``*
  * Standby After: *``0 minutes``*
  * Suspend After: *``0 minutes``*
  * Off After: *``0 minutes``*
  * Quick Power-off in Blank Only Mode: *``enabled``*

Note that powerkit will start *XScreenSaver* during startup (unless *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* is disabled).

Support for alternative screen savers can be added if needed.

## BACKLIGHT

The current display brightness (on laptops) can be adjusted with the mouse wheel on the system tray icon or through the system tray menu.

## HIBERNATE

If hibernate *"just works"* depends on your system, worst case a swap partition (or file) is needed by the kernel to support hibernate, just add *``resume=<swap_partition>``* to the kernel command line in the boot loader.

***Consult your system documentation regarding hibernation***.

## ICONS

powerkit will use the existing icon theme from the running desktop environment. You should have (a proper version) of Adwaita installed as a fallback.

You can override the icon theme in the *`~/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf`* file, see *``icon_theme=<theme_name>``*.

# FAQ

## Slackware-only?

No, powerkit should work on any Linux system. However, powerkit is developed on/for Slackware and sees minimal testing on other systems (feedback and/or bug reports for other systems are welcome).

## How does an application inhibit the screen saver?

The preferred way to inhibit the screen saver from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* will work with powerkit.

*Note that powerkit also includes ``SimulateUserActivity`` for backwards compatibility*.

Popular applications that uses this feature is Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, VideoLAN VLC and many more.

## How does an application inhibit suspend actions?

The preferred way to inhibit suspend actions from an application is to use the *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* specification. Any application that uses *org.freedesktop.PowerManagement* will work with powerkit.

Common use cases are audio playback, downloading and more.

## Google Chrome/Chromium does not inhibit the screen saver!?

*[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)* does not use *org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver* until it detects a supported desktop environment *(KDE/Xfce)*. Add the following to *``~/.bashrc``* or the *``google-chrome``* launcher if you don't run a desktop environment:

```
export DESKTOP_SESSION=xfce
export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=xfce
```

# REQUIREMENTS

powerkit requires the following dependencies:

 * *[X11](https://www.x.org)*
 * *[Xss](https://www.x.org/archive//X11R7.7/doc/man/man3/Xss.3.xhtml)*
 * *[Xrandr](https://www.x.org/wiki/libraries/libxrandr/)*
 * *[QtDBus](https://qt.io)* 4.8+
 * *[QtGui](https://qt.io)* 4.8+
 * *[QtCore](https://qt.io)* 4.8+
 * *[D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)*
 * *[ConsoleKit](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/ConsoleKit/)* or *[logind](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/logind/)* *(will work without, but with limited functions)*
 * *[UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/)* 0.9.23+
 * *[XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)*
 * *[adwaita-icon-theme](https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme)* *(or similar)*

# BUILD

First make sure you have the required dependencies installed, then review the most common build options:

 * *``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</usr/local>``* - Install target. *``/usr``* recommended.
 * *``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release/Debug>``* - Build type. *``Release``* recommended
 * *``USE_QT5=<ON/OFF>``* - Build against Qt5 (*``OFF``* if you want use Qt4).
 * *``SERVICE_USER=<root>``* - powerkitd owner, needs write access to /sys. Usually the *``root``* user.
 * *``SERVICE_GROUP=<power>``* - Group that can access the powerkitd service, this should be any desktop user that can change screen brightness, CPU performance and RTC wake alarm. Usually the *``power``* group.

Now configure powerkit with CMake and build (*example for packaging purposes*).
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make DESTDIR=<package> install
```
```
