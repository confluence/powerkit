\f[B]Do use powerkit if your desktop environment or window manager
already has a power manager or screen saver service running.\f[R]
.SS CONFIGURATION
The most common options are available directly from the system tray
icon, for more advanced options open \f[I]\f[CI]Settings\f[I]\f[R] from
the system tray menu or run \f[I]\f[CI]powerkit --config\f[I]\f[R].
You should also be able to lauch the powerkit settings from your desktop
application menu (if available).
.SS SCREEN SAVER
powerkit implements a basic screen saver to handle screen blanking,
poweroff and locking feature.
.PP
Locking feature depends on \f[CR]xsecurelock\f[R].
.PP
You can override the lock command with
\f[I]\f[CI]screensaver_lock_cmd=<command>\f[I]\f[R] in
\f[I]\f[CI]\[ti]/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf\f[I]\f[R].
Note that the command must not contain spaces.
.SS BACKLIGHT
The current display brightness (on laptops and supported displays) can
be adjusted with the mouse wheel on the system tray icon or through the
system tray menu.
.SS HIBERNATE
If hibernate works depends on your system, a swap partition (or file) is
needed by the kernel to support hibernate.
.PP
\f[B]\f[BI]Consult your system documentation regarding
hibernation\f[B]\f[R].
.SS ICONS
powerkit will use the existing icon theme from the running desktop
environment or window manager.
.PP
You can override the icon theme in the
\f[I]\f[CI]\[ti]/.config/powerkit/powerkit.conf\f[I]\f[R] file, use
\f[I]\f[CI]icon_theme=<theme_name>\f[I]\f[R].
.SH FAQ
.SS How does an application inhibit the screen saver?
The preferred way to inhibit the screen saver from an application is to
use the \f[I]org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver\f[R] specification.
Any application that uses \f[I]org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver\f[R] will
work with powerkit.
.PP
Popular applications that uses this feature is Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, VideoLAN VLC and many more.
.SS How does an application inhibit suspend actions?
The preferred way to inhibit suspend actions from an application is to
use the \f[I]org.freedesktop.PowerManagement\f[R] specification.
Any application that uses \f[I]org.freedesktop.PowerManagement\f[R] will
work with powerkit.
.PP
Common use cases are audio playback, downloading, rendering and similar.
.SS Google Chrome/Chromium does not inhibit the screen saver or power manager!?
\f[I]Chrome (https://chrome.google.com)\f[R] does not use
\f[I]org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver\f[R] or
\f[I]org.freedesktop.PowerManagement\f[R] until it detects a supported
desktop environment.
Add the following to \f[I]\f[CI]\[ti]/.bashrc\f[I]\f[R] or the
\f[I]\f[CI]google-chrome\f[I]\f[R] launcher if you don\[cq]t run a
supported desktop environment:

.SH BUILD
First make sure you have the required dependencies installed, then
review the most common build options:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]\f[CI]CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</usr/local>\f[I]\f[R] - Install target.
\f[I]\f[CI]/usr\f[I]\f[R] recommended.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]\f[CI]CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Release/Debug>\f[I]\f[R] - Build type.
\f[I]\f[CI]Release\f[I]\f[R] recommended
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]\f[CI]SERVICE_USER=<root>\f[I]\f[R] - powerkitd owner, needs write
access to /sys.
Usually the \f[I]\f[CI]root\f[I]\f[R] user.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]\f[CI]SERVICE_GROUP=<power>\f[I]\f[R] - Group that can access the
powerkitd service, this should be any desktop user.
Consult your system documentation for the preferred user group.
.PP
Now configure powerkit with CMake and build (\f[I]example for packaging
purposes\f[R]).
